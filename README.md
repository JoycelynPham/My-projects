# WORLD HAPPINESS 2015-2023

The World Happiness Report is a publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It ranks countries according to their happiness levels, based on 6 factors, including GDP per capita, life expectancy, social support, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

The purpose of this project is to conduct a data analysis of the World Happiness Report data. The goal is to identify how happiness changed over time, the factors that are most important for happiness and to explore the relationships between these factors.
