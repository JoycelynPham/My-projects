# WORLD HAPPINESS 2015-2023

The World Happiness Report is a publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It ranks countries according to their happiness levels, based on 6 factors, including GDP per capita, life expectancy, social support, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

The purpose of this project is to conduct a data analysis of the World Happiness Report data. The goal is to identify how happiness changed over time, the factors that are most important for happiness and to explore the relationships between these factors.

# About Dataset
Data source: https://worldhappiness.report/


The dataset includes information from approximately 150 countries for the years 2015-2023. The variables in the data set include:
  - The happiness score is a measure of how satisfied people are with their lives on a scale of 0 to 10. The higher the score, the happier the country.
  - The GDP per capita is a measure of the average income of a country. The higher the GDP per capita, the wealthier the country.
  - The life expectancy is a measure of how long people are expected to live in a country. The higher the life expectancy, the healthier the country.
  - The social support is a measure of how much people feel supported by their family and friends. The higher the social support, the happier the country.
  - The freedom to make life choices is a measure of how much people feel they can control their own lives. The higher the freedom to make life choices, the happier the country.
  - The generosity is a measure of how much people give to charity and help others. The higher the generosity, the happier the country.
  - The perceptions of corruption is a measure of how corrupt people believe the government is. The lower the perceptions of corruption, the happier the country.

# Project Objective:
The purpose of this project is to explore:
- How happiness scores evolved over this time span
- The most influential factors contributing to happiness, and the intricate relationships between these factors. Choose the top-ranked and bottom-ranked countries as two case studies and visualize the engagement data
- Additionally, integrate the Covid-19 dataset to examine the relationship between the Happiness score and the Covid-19 situation across countries
    - Covid-19 data source: https://covid19.who.int/data
    - World population data source: https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV/

# Techniques: 
- Using Pandas to clean and analyze data from The World Happiness Report, which comprised 9 datasets with 1367 entries, encompassing information from approximately 150 countries for the years 2015-2023
- Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the data

# Insights:
- The initial analysis indicated relatively stable happiness scores over time. Developed countries consistently ranked highest, while poorer and underdeveloped countries tended to rank lower on the happiness scale.
- Key factors influencing happiness included GDP per capita, life expectancy, and social support.
- Case studies of top and bottom-ranked countries, visually presented, highlighted significant disparities and offered valuable insights into varying happiness levels across nations.
- Countries with high happiness scores may have higher COVID-19 infection rates than countries with low happiness scores.
